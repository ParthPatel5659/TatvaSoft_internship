## 🧠 Skills Gained
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** – Database design and SQL querying
- ⚙️ **.NET Core** – RESTful API development

- 🔐 **JWT** – Secure user authentication
- ☁️ **AWS** – Cloud services and deployment

---

## 🚧 Development Setup

### 🔥 Start Development Server

```bash
ng serve
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

---

### 🛠️ Code Scaffolding

To generate a new component:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For other schematics like directives, services, or modules, run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

---

### 🏗️ Build the Application

To build the project for production:

```bash
ng build
```

The compiled files will be located in the `dist/` directory. The production build includes optimizations for performance and speed.

---

### ✅ Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests using Karma:

```bash
ng test
```

This will launch the test runner in watch mode.

---

### 🧪 Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

To execute end-to-end tests:

```bash
ng e2e
```

> Note: Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can integrate Cypress, Protractor, or Playwright as per project needs.
